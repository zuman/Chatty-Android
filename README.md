A chat messenger which maintained privacy by enabling users to create a unique Chatty ID which is to be used to contact them.

* I used www.000webhost.com to host server files. 
* Server scripting was done in PHP. Files are included.
* Database MySQl was used. Database schema not included. You'll figure out database tables and fields by looking at the php scripts.

## The project was running perfectly when it was created.
### Now, it is not running live because the 000webhost connected account was deactived after it served it's purpose (It was a college project ;) ).
### But the source code is not open to learn.
